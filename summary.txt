I increased the item range to 15-30 item per customer. It increased the wait time since checkers had more items to process and decreased their idle time. 
The average shopping times also increase as each shopper spent more time per item. 
Changing the arrival rate, slowed down arrivals. It reduced the wait time for shoppers and increased idle time.  
The number of checkers was adjusted to ten which was more than enough for a 6-minute arrival time. It resulted in low wait times and high idle times. 

I added two functions: 
Average shopping time: The average shoppers had 15-30 items, so their shopping times increased.
Total shoppers: When arrivals rate was increased the total number of shoppers dropped, decreasing wait times and increasing idle time.
